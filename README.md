### Hey 👋, I'm Prashant, a Machine Learning Engineer based in Tokyo, Japan.

I write [Agentic Coding Weekly](https://www.agenticcodingweekly.com/), a newsletter for focused updates on agentic coding tools, models, and workflows without any hype, marketing fluff, or industry gossip.

From 2019-2025, I used to work at Mercari, Inc. in Tokyo, building production ML systems for Japan’s largest C2C marketplace. At Mercari, I led ML/NLP/LLM applications on Japanese text in Customer Support and Trust & Safety domains. I led the development of ML-driven product moderation system for Mercari Shops. Before that, I shipped features like automatic high-risk inquiry escalation, LLM-powered auto-replies, and intelligent inquiry routing.

B.Tech, IIT Delhi (2019). Speaker, PyCon JP 2024 and PyCon APAC 2023.
