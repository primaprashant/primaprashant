### Hey 👋, I'm Prashant Anand.

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer working in Tokyo, Japan for the last two years.

### What I'm Working On

1. 👨‍💻 I'm a machine learning engineer/tech lead at Mercari, Inc. in Tokyo, Japan. I use machine learning in the customer support domain to improve the experience of our customers when they send us inquiries.
2. 🎙 I co-host a bi-weekly podcast called [Tech Culture Podcast](https://www.techculturepodcast.com/) with [Kaustubh](https://twitter.com/_ofkaus) where we talk about emerging startups, interesting tech products and business trends.
3. 🐦 On [Twitter](https://twitter.com/primaprashant), I regularly write about applied machine learning and NLP.
4. 💌 I send a newsletter every Sunday morning about new ideas and concepts I learned during the week. [Sign up for the my newsletter, The Ordered Entropy](https://www.theorderedentropy.com/).
