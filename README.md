### Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Prashant, a Machine Learning Engineer based in Tokyo, Japan.

From 2019-2025, I used to work at Mercari, Inc. in Tokyo, building production ML systems for Japanâ€™s largest C2C marketplace. At Mercari, I led ML/NLP/LLM applications on Japanese text in Customer Support and Trust & Safety domains. I led the development of ML-driven product moderation system for Mercari Shops. Before that, I shipped features like automatic high-risk inquiry escalation, LLM-powered auto-replies, and intelligent inquiry routing.
